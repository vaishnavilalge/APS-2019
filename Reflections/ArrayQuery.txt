Popular query optimisation techniques user are:

LOOK UP TABLE
Here lookup table is a 2D array.
*	Time complexity = O(n^2)
*	Space complexity = O(n^2)
*	Searching/fetching time for an element = O(1)

SQUARE ROOT DECOMPOSITION:
Here table is a 1D array.
*	Requires scanning of all the elements to build the table.
* Time complexity = O(sqrt(n))
*	Space complexity = O(sqrt(n)).
*	Searching/fetching time for an element =O(sqrt(n))

SEGMENT TREE:
Here a tree structure is built.
*	Tree constructing time = O(nlogn).
*	Space complexity = O(nlogn).
*	Searching/fetch time = O(logn).

NOTE: lookup table and square root decomposition technique is effecient when values change ie, when its dynamic
whereas segment tree is effecient when values are static.
